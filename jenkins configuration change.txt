when we have higher version of jdk (i.e more than 11) we have to change certian configurations in cmd prompt to execute jenkins:

It works with "java -jar jenkins.war --enable-future-java --httpPort=9090".

Steps:

Go to directory where Jenkins.war is places
open cmd
Enter java -jar jenkins.war --enable-future-java --httpPort=9090
Jenkins will start. then Go to "http://localhost:9090/" and enter "initialAdminPassword" then Jenkins will start properly.
